<h1>Programming assignment 2</h1>
<p>Replace this HTML markup with markup for your game. Your game does not need to literally be a rock scissors paper game but it <em>must</em> do the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Prompt the user for an input that is then saved as a <em>variable</em></li>
	<li>Have at least 1 element that is saved as a <em>constant</em></li>
	<li>Compare 2 or more strings using a <em>comparison operator</em></li>
	<li>Use an <em>'if / else' conditional statement</em></li>
	<li>Have images that appear based on those conditions</li>
	<li>Feature an AI player that makes a choice by generating a <em>random number</em></li>
	<li>Your program should be user friendly: if the player inputs a string that the program does not recognize, it should ask the player to try again and case should not matter. (i.e.: your program should recognize 'Rock', 'ROCK', and 'rock' as the same word.)</li>
	<li>Place your JavaScript code in a separate .js file </li>
</ol>
<p>Your code should also not display any errors in the console.</p>
